# SS19 ML@Freiburg Competition

This contains my solution for the ML competition at the university of Freiburg.

The task was to use our data science- and machine learning skills, which we had learned on the ML course, to predict the average price avocadoes.

My simple approach relies on encoding categorical features through dummy- and one-hot encoding and then fitting an XGBoost model on the data.
